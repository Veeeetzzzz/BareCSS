# BareCSS
Why use frameworks when you have the original magic?
# Features
 Ultra Lightweight: 0KB minified and zipped. Because it's basically nothing.
 
 Super Fast: Renders at the speed of your browser's default rendering engine.
 
 Zero Dependencies: It's just CSS!
 
 Fully Compatible: Works on every browser ever made (that supports CSS).

# Installation


Grab the latest version of BareCSS from our this repo, it's one file.

Link the bare.css file in your HTML document within the <head> section.

    html

    <link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/bare.css">

Write CSS As Usual

Start crafting your styles in your own CSS file or within <style> tags in your HTML. BareCSS doesn't change the way you write CSS; it just makes it more... bare.

Example:

    css

    .myClass {
    color: blue;
    }

Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰
You're now using BareCSS
